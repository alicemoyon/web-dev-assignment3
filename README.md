This website contains three pages: index.php, customers.php and orders.php.

1. Index.php </br>
This page should show the major product lines available from the Classic Models company and the
text description of each product line. When the user chooses a specific product line the full listing
for that product line should be displayed in tabular format. Only one product line should be shown
at any time.</br>

2. Customers.php</br>
This page should list all the customers in the database, grouped by country, e.g. customers from
France, customers from Norway. Only the following information should be shown for each
customer: customer name, country, city and phone number.</br>

3. Orders.php</br>
This page should display three tables with the following information:
Table 1 - all orders currently “In process”.
Table 2 – all cancelled orders.
Table 3 – the 20 most recent orders.

By default, the following information will be shown for each order: order number, order date,
and status. When the user clicks on the order number for any order the full information for this
order will be displayed, including the product code, product line, product name, and any
comments included with the specific order.
